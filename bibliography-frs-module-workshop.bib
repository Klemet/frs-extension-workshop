  abstract = {Forest managers are faced with complicated road construction and deactivation decisions. When construction, upgrading, and deactivation strategies must be determined simultaneously over broad spatial and temporal scales, the problem becomes very complex and decision support systems are needed. In this paper, we report the development and application of an optimal road class and deactivation model using dynamic programming. We tested our model on projected road networks on Hardwicke Island, British Columbia. Sensitivity of inputs such as construction costs, upgrade costs, hauling and maintenance costs, deactivation costs, length of time horizon, discount rate, and haul volume were tested within and between two road networks. Comparison of road networks revealed that haul volume concentration, average haul distance, and total road length are the most important variables that affect road class decisions and total network costs. Within our case study, the road network with the lowest average hauling distance resulted in the lowest total cost (CAN\$0.24/m3 less), because hauling costs are the largest component (46\%) of total transportation costs. The dynamic programming model can be used to assess numerous road construction and maintenance assumptions under various silviculture and harvest systems.},

  abstract = {Forest roads are a necessary element for accessing forestry resources, but their impact on the environment can be significant. Forest roads can cause a variety of impacts on local wildlife that may lead to extirpation: facilitating the spread of invasive organisms, causing death or harm by vehicle strikes, and changing the behavior of animals to their detriment. Roads create improved access to forests, which can increase predation rates from hunters. Animals may move to avoid traffic noise, increasing their vulnerability to predation by other animals. One of the most significant impacts of forest roads is on water quality, through both catastrophic and chronic sources of water pollution, primarily from sediment. While it is not the case that every road will cause any or all of these impacts, for those that do, mitigation measures can be used to lessen these negative effects. These mitigation measures must begin during the location phase of the road and should continue through construction, use, and maintenance of the roads. Application of these mitigation measures allows forest managers to minimize the impacts from their forest roads when necessary.},

Les facteurs tant \'ecologiques que socio-\'economiques, li\'es \`a cette construction effr\'en\'ee de routes sont d\'ej\`a abord\'es aux \'Etats-Unis et dans d'autres provinces canadiennes, mais tr\`es peu consid\'er\'es au Qu\'ebec. Nous \'evaluons ici l'ensemble des effets dans un contexte qu\'eb\'ecois et proposons des pistes de solutions \`a l'approche utilis\'ee aujourd'hui. Sur le plan \'ecologique, les effets sont principalement la destruction et la fragmentation des habitats, la mortalit\'e due aux collisions avec les v\'ehicules, la modification du comportement animal, l'alt\'eration de l'environnement physique et chimique, la propagation d'esp\`eces exotiques et l'utilisation anthropique croissante du territoire. De plus, le d\'eveloppement rapide du r\'eseau routier dans des r\'egions \'eloign\'ees \'elimine les opportunit\'es de prot\'eger des territoires intacts et des for\^ets vierges. Du point de vue socio-\'economique, les int\'er\^ets \'economiques li\'es \`a l'industrie foresti\`ere sont pratiquement les seuls pris en compte. Le vaste r\'eseau de chemins forestiers rend accessible tous les territoires, cr\'eant parfois des conflits avec les autres utilisateurs du milieu et rendant plus difficile la gestion des ressources fauniques. Le maintien des valeurs culturelles, notamment pour les communaut\'es autochtones, est \'egalement un enjeu. Au plan strictement \'economique, il faut int\'egrer les externalit\'es dans les co\^uts et avantages li\'es \`a l'utilisation du territoire et de ses ressources, afin de faire des choix objectifs et \'eclair\'es quant \`a la meilleure utilisation qui soit aux plans \'ecologique, \'economique, social et culturel. Cela inclut notamment la prise en compte des fonctions \'ecologiques du territoire et les retomb\'ees \'economiques \`a long terme, li\'ees au r\'ecr\'eotourisme. Parmi les solutions sugg\'er\'ees, il appara\^it tout d'abord imp\'eratif de diminuer la construction de routes et de prot\'eger de vastes territoires encore intacts. Pour ce qui est du r\'eseau routier d\'ej\`a existant, diff\'erentes mesures sont propos\'ees afin d'att\'enuer les impacts : fermer et reboiser certaines routes, limiter l'acc\`es, \'eriger certaines structures afin de permettre \`a la faune de traverser les routes indispensables et d'assurer la connectivit\'e des habitats. Parall\`element \`a ces initiatives, des programmes de recherche et d'\'education devraient \^etre entrepris. En outre, des modifications aux lois existantes sont requises, tout comme l'\'elaboration de politiques ou de strat\'egies gouvernementales visant sp\'ecifiquement la gestion durable des r\'eseaux routiers. Le Qu\'ebec est en retard. Il doit changer d'approche dans sa gestion du r\'eseau routier et prendre des mesures appropri\'ees en s'inspirant des strat\'egies adopt\'ees ailleurs.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Many forested landscapes are fragmented by roads, but our understanding of the effects of these roads on the function and diversity of the surrounding forest is in its infancy. I investigated the effect of roads in otherwise continuous forests on the macroinvertebrate fauna of the soil. I took soil samples along transects leading away from the edges of unpaved roads in the Cherokee National Forest in the Southern Appalachian mountains of the United States. Roads significantly depressed both the abundance and the richness of the macroinvertebrate soil fauna. Roads also significantly reduced the depth of the leaf-litter layer. These effects persisted up to 100 m into the forest. Wider roads and roads with more open canopies tended to produce steeper declines in abundance, richness, and leaf-litter depth, but these effects were significant only for canopy cover and litter depth. The macroinvertebrate fauna of the leaf litter plays a pivotal role in the ability of the soil to process energy and nutrients. These macroinvertebrates also provide prey for vertebrate species such as salamanders and ground-foraging birds. The effect of roads on the surrounding forest is compounded by the sprawling nature of the road system in this and many other forests. My data suggest that even relatively narrow roads through forests can produce marked edge effects that may have negative consequences for the function and diversity of the forest ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The paper reviews traditional and computer-assisted road network layout approaches and brings them together in an overall stream of development. It results in the main finding that changes in the representation of the road network layout problem triggered major scientific advancements. A systematic, 2D transport geometry representation emerged in the 1870s and led to the mathematical derivation of optimal road spacing. The representation of road network and harvest layout problem as a mathematical graph and the solution of the corresponding linear programming problem, triggered a representational shift in the early 1970s. The broad availability of digital elevation models DEMs at the beginning of the 1990s was another representational innovation, enabling an automatic road route layout on the terrain DEM surface. The most recent shift consisted of systems to semi-automatically, concurrently laying out harvest/transport-network problems on DEMs in the mid-1990s. The review identifies challenges for future research, among which the extension of the concurrent harvest/road-network layout systems for multi-objective functions is the first importance. Considering that scientific advancement is mostly going along with changes in problem representations, research should explore improved representations for lattice type terrain representation, among which triangular irregular network (TIN) meshes seem to be the first interest. Additional paths for improvements are the integration of road network planning with detailed road engineering, the refinement of optimization problems formulations, and the cross-national adaptation of road network planning courses to operations-research-based approaches.},

We tested the hypothesis that linear corridors affect caribou and wolf activities by examining the distribution of 2,616 telemetry locations of caribou, 27 caribou mortality sites, 592 telemetry locations of wolves (Canis lupus), and 76 sites where wolves had preyed on large ungulates relative to linear corridors in caribou range and well-drained sites in northeastern Alberta. Of the 98 radiocollared caribou, 35 were significantly further than random from corridors and only 3 were significantly closer. The mean difference between caribou and random locations (106 m) was significantly different from zero. Within caribou range, wolf locations were closer (134 m) than random to linear corridors. Wolf predation sites were not significantly closer to corridors than were wolf locations or random points. Caribou mortalities attributed to wolf predation were closer (316 m) to linear corridors than were live locations from all caribou, indicating that caribou that are close to linear corridors are at a higher risk of depredation. Each caribou mortality attributed to wolf predation was closer to a corridor than their telemetry locations while alive (mean difference = 204 m). Caribou mortalities caused by humans were 174 m closer to corridors than all live caribou locations, however this difference was not significant. Increased industrial activity in caribou range could have a significant effect on caribou population dynamics by increasing predation. The development of new corridors within caribou habitat should be minimized and existing corridors should be made unsuitable as travel routes to reduce the impacts of industrial development on caribou populations.},

  abstract = {The total network of Finnish forest roads has increased from a few hundred km in 1950 to currently over 120,000 km, but the ecological consequences of that process on invertebrates are poorly understood. I pitfall-trapped carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) at roadsides and in adjacent forests along six forest roads in Finland. I carried out two studies on whether roads function as obstacles to the movement of forest carabids, or dispersal corridors for generalist and open-habitat species. In addition to these two studies, I compiled carabid observations from national entomologists to get an overview on carabid richness and on life-history traits associated with roadside carabids. A forest carabid Calathus micropterus (Duftschmid) was less abundant on the roadsides, compared to the adjacent forests. However, species richness and the abundance of a habitat generalist Pterostichus niger (Schaller) showed the opposite, and open-habitat species were solely caught on the roadsides. At the roadsides, generalists decreased in abundance with increasing distance to the nearest large open-habitat area along the road. This result may indicate that roadsides are dispersal corridors and/or ``sink'' habitat for these carabids. I did not detect such a trend for open-habitat species, which may indicate that roadsides are habitats, not just dispersal corridors for these carabids. Multivariate Regression Trees showed that the roadside and forest carabid assemblages were different. Forest type played a key role in shaping carabid assemblages of forests, whereas roadside carabid assemblages were mostly affected by factors related to lighting conditions (road width, proximity of open habitat, and compass direction). I caught several forest carabids between the ruts of forest roads, indicating that these beetles frequently cross forest roads. The 97 carabid species found by Finnish entomologists from different kinds of roadsides, reported here, indicate that roadsides host rich carabid assemblages of relatively common species mostly associated with open and man-made habitats.},

However, forest road construction and maintenance involve economic and environmental costs. For these reasons, forest road network planning is a fundamental phase of forest management, maximising the benefits and reducing costs and impacts. Thanks to modern technologies in data collection both for terrestrial and forest characteristics, new methods and tools have been developed to improve and facilitate road planning. The aim of this study was the development of a Decision Support System for helping managers during forest road network planning, exploiting Multi-Criteria Analysis, an Analytic Hierarchy Process and Geographic Information Systems. Three steps characterised the study: \TH{} an in-depth survey of the existing forest road network \TH{} an accessibility evaluation, based on a commonly applied Italian definition, taking into account the morphological characteristics of the land \TH{} an estimation of the accessibility requirements through the analysis of experts' opinions, defined as Road Needs Index, based on different factors These phases were applied to a forest property located in northern Italy, and some improvements were proposed simulating a manager's approach during planning. The results showed interesting features in accessibility evaluation, which identified three different classes of accessibility, represented in a map. The estimation of Road Needs Index assigned a class regarding road requirements to each forest management unit: \guillemotright low\guillemotleft, \guillemotright medium\guillemotleft, \guillemotright high\guillemotleft{} and \guillemotright very high\guillemotleft. This information was merged, becoming a useful tool to identify the forest areas with the highest problems in relation to the forest road network.},

Therefore, we sought to examine the effects of forest roads on fire boundary locations. We analysed six fires within the Wenatchee National Forest in Washington State. Geographic Information System datasets of fire boundaries and environmental variables were obtained from government agencies. Case points were sampled on the fire boundaries, and five matching control points were sampled inside the fire boundary for each case. Matched case\textendash control logistic regression was performed to identify the environmental differences between each case and its set of control points. We found that for four of the fires, fire boundaries were significantly closer to roads than to random control points. Various terrain and vegetation attributes were also correlated with fire boundary locations. In the fires where road effects were significant, they had stronger effects than any of the other environmental constraints on fire boundary locations. These results suggest that road effects on fire cessation should be incorporated more explicitly into landscape-level assessment of wildfire risk and analyses of fuel treatment effectiveness.},

However, none of these studies has considered habitat use and reproductive success to address mechanisms underlying the observed pattern, and most were conducted in fragmented landscapes and ignored juxtapositions of forest with narrow openings such as roads. We studied the influence of forest roads on Ovenbird density in an extensively forested region of Vermont, evaluating habitat use and reproductive success relative to mechanisms proposed to explain the density-edge relationship. Territory densities on seven study plots were 40\% lower within edge areas (0 to 150 m from unpaved roads) than within interior areas (150 to 300 m from roads). We simulated the distribution of Ovenbird territories and concluded that passive displacement, where birds perceive habitat interfaces as boundaries and limit their territories entirely to forest habitat, did not account for the observed density-edge pattern. Territory size was inversely related to distance from roads, providing an alternative explanation for reduced densities near edges and suggesting that habitat quality was higher away from roads. Pairing success was lower within edge areas than within interior zones, but the difference was not statistically significant. The proportion of males that produced fledglings did not differ between edge and interior areas. We conclude that habitat quality for Ovenbirds may be lower within 150 m of unpaved roads in extensive forested landscapes, affecting territory density and possibly reproductive success.},

The number of patches, mean patch area, mean interior area, mean area of edge influence, mean patch perimeter, total perimeter, and mean patch shape identified patch- and edge-related landscape changes. Shannon-Wiener diversity, dominance, contagion, contrast, and angular second moment indicated effects on landscape diversity and texture. Roads added to forest fragmentation more than clearcuts by dissecting large patches into smaller pieces and by converting forest interior habitat into edge habitat. Edge habitat created by roads was 1.54\textendash 1.98 times the edge habitat created by clearcuts. The total landscape area affected by clearcuts and roads was 2.5\textendash 3.5 times the actual area occupied by these disturbances. Fragmentation due to roads could be minimized if road construction is minimized or rerouted so that its fragmentation effects are reduced.

  abstract = {Through computational experiments, we conducted a comparative study of the performance of heuristic algorithms for the multiple target access problem (MTAP). MTAP requires the minimum cost road network accessible to given targets on forest land to be designed via the construction of new roads from existing road networks. We first show that MTAP can be transformed into the Steiner tree problem (STP) in graph theory, by identifying nodes representing existing road networks. This allows us to use STP algorithms for solving MTAP. Because of NP-hardness of STP, we apply heuristic algorithms in this study. In our computational experiments, each of 14 heuristic STP algorithms, of which many have the performance guarantee of twice the optimal, solves 1,120 MTAP instances with various properties. Upon analysis of the results, we conclude that the average distance heuristic (ADH) and repetitive applications of the shortest path heuristic (SPHV, SPH- Z, SPH-zZ, and SPH-ZZ) exhibit consistently superior performance in terms of solution quality. Additionally, we confirm that ADH, SPH-V, and SPH-ZZ design similarly shaped road network layouts.},

  abstract = {Supporting wildfire management activities is frequently identified as a benefit of forest roads. As such, there is a growing body of research into forest road planning, construction, and maintenance to improve fire surveillance, prevention, access, and control operations. Of interest here is how road networks directly support fire control operations, and how managers incorporate that information into pre-season assessment and planning. In this communication we briefly review and illustrate how forest roads relate to recent advances in operationally focused wildfire decision support. We focus on two interrelated products used on the National Forest System and adjacent lands throughout the western USA: potential wildland fire operational delineations (PODs) and potential control locations (PCLs). We use real-world examples from the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado, USA to contextualize these concepts and illustrate how fire analytics and local fire managers both identified roads as primary control features. Specifically, distance to road was identified as the most important predictor variable in the PCL boosted regression model, and 82\% of manager-identified POD boundaries aligned with roads. Lastly, we discuss recommendations for future research, emphasizing roles for enhanced decision support and empirical analysis.},

  abstract = {Forest landscape models (FLMs) are widely used to examine the influence of disturbances on long-term and broad-scale forest ecosystem dynamics. However, FLMs are not well-suited to simulating some types of management or disturbance regimes, including land-use change. Consequently, there are situations in which a researcher may wish to estimate the timing and location of events externally, either from a different model, empirical observations, or some other source, and then incorporate them into an FLM. We present Land Use Plus (LU+), an extension for the LANDIS-II FLM that allows users to integrate externally-developed, spatially and temporally explicit representations of land use or other disturbance into simulations. LU\th{} allows users to model the proximate effects of these events on forest composition and biomass, as well as subsequent dynamics, including tree establishment and the potential for future management. LU\th{} will significantly increase the breadth of research questions for which LANDIS-II may be appropriately used.},

  abstract = {Landscape patterns influence a range of ecological processes at multiple spatial scales. Landscape pattern metrics are often used to study the patterns that result from the linear and nonlinear interactions between spatial aggregation and abundance of habitat. However, many class-level pattern metrics are highly correlated with habitat abundance, making their use as a measure of habitat fragmentation problematic. We argue that a class-level pattern metric should be (1) able to differentiate landscapes across a range of spatial aggregations, and (2) independent of habitat abundance, if it is to be used to distinguish between effects of habitat amount and fragmentation. Based on these criteria and using both simulated and actual landscapes, we evaluated 64 class-level pattern metrics. These metrics were reclassified into four groups based on their correlation with aggregation and abundance. Among all these metrics, nine were considered robust for fragmentation measurements, which cover most of the characteristics that define pattern, including core area, shape, proximity / isolation, contrast, and contagion / interspersion. Optimal metrics for individual studies will depend on both biological rationales and statistically robust metrics that are appropriate for achieving each study objectives.},

  abstract = {Fire shapes landscapes long after the flames are extinguished by leaving legacies of heterogeneous fuel mosaics, species composition patterns, and age classes. Fire perimeters have received little research attention, but their locations have implications for both landscape patterns and processes, including vegetation structure and subsequent disturbances. In this study, we focused on the role of previous wildfires and roads in limiting wildfire growth and influencing the pattern of fire at a regional scale. Using fire perimeter data from the U.S. Southwest, we asked (1) to what degree previous wildfires and roads limit the spread of subsequent fires, (2) what the temporal patterns are in fire perimeter limitations, in terms of time-since-fire and stability of patterns over time, and (3) whether limitations to fire spread differ across National Forests and topographic variables. We found strong evidence that previous fires and roads play a role in limiting subsequent fire progression. Of fires that spatially intersected previous wildfires, 8.7\% of fire perimeters aligned only with previous wildfire perimeters. On average, 25.7\% of fire perimeters aligned only with roads, compared to 11.6\% when fires were randomly shifted, and road alignments tended to be on less steep slopes than wildfire alignments. More than 60\% of fire perimeter alignments occurred when time since the previous fire was 5 years or less. Finally, results varied by National Forest; the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, which have fairly flat terrain, had high percentages of fire-road alignments while the Gila National Forest, which contains a large amount of Wilderness, had the most fire-fire alignments. As more fires burn, fire interactions are likely to increase, and previous fire footprints may have more opportunity to act as fuel breaks or control points for subsequent fires.},
